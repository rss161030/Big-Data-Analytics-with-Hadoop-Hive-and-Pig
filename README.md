# Big-Data-Analytics-with-Hadoop-Hive-and-Pig

I have analyzed the Dallas Police Data using Hadoop, Hive and Pig to find the patterns in crimes. I have used the open dataset 'Dallas Police Data'. I joined this dataset with various other demographic datasets to solve my problem statements.

The problem statements for this project are as follows:

I will link the Dallas police data to another data set that provides data for location of subway stops, school area, shopping
malls, and residential areas to determine the correlation among various factors like robberies seem to cluster 
around subway stops, whether burglaries decline during school hours.

I will link the data from the day of the week column and the number of incidents happening on each particular 
day (Like clustering of data). I can go further and analyze the number of incidents happening on each particular
day in each zip code thereby understanding the frequency of crimes on each zip code on particular day of the week.

I will link the number of crimes data against race, gender and age columns of this dataset to another dataset 
that provides the age and gender data for each zip code to find the number of incidents that are occurring against 
the respective category (like male and female in gender, Race, Age intervals) to determine which specific subgroup 
are the victims based on zip code data.

I will link the Dallas Police Data with the poverty rates by zip code data in the last 20 years to analyze the
trend in the crime data in each zip code and run trees and random forests with the number of crime incidents as
my predictor variable and population, poverty, average household income as my independent variables.

I will compare the number of crimes and the type of crimes that are taking place in each reporting area, beat,
division, watch, day, month and zip code to find any correlation among the variables and the type of crime by using clustering techniques or classification techniques.

I will use HDFS, Hive and Pig for storing, processing and analyzing the data. I will use Excel and Tableau
for my visualizations.
